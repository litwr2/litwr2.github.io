<p>To use enhanced quicksort you must first prepare an environment for it. The next subroutine can help with it.<br>
<code>
6000 I%=HIMEM-1024:HIMEM=I%:DIM Q% 617<br>
6010 OSCLI"LOAD EQSOBJ "+STR$~I%:CALLI%:HIMEM=I%+1024:RETURN<br>
</code>
This subroutine can be invoked, for example, by<br>
<code>GOSUB6000</code><br>
somewhere in the beginning of your program. Of course, you also need program EQSOBJ on your disc.

<p>In a proper environment you may use<br>
<code>CALL Q%,N%,START</code><br>
to sort a string array where N% is a number of elements to sort and START is the first element in the range of elements to sort. For example,<br>
<code>CALL Q%,N%,A$(0)</code><br>
means to sort N% elements of array A$ from index 0 to index N-1. You may use any arithmetic expression in place of any array index.

<p>A demo program, which uses the CALL, can be loaded with<br>
<code>LOAD"QTESTS"</code><br>
and started with RUN. You may change the seed for the random number generator in line 30. You can also change the maximum array size in this line &ndash; reduce the value of M% if there is NO ROOM error. This program also contains a non-recursive quicksort routine implemented in Basic (lines 5000-5300).

<p>The disk contains a README-file which can be displayed by *TYPE README.
