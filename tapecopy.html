<h1>TAPECOPY</h1><br>

<p>This program main purpose is to move programs from tapes to disks.
It knows all turboloader's formats known in 1989 in Poland or Russia.
It may be also used to move data from WAV files using appropriate 
emulators. Tapecopy may also copy programs from one tape to another 
(or to the same in the 'forever?' emulator), saving is always performed 
in the standard format. 

<h2>User Manual</h2>

<p>Tapecopy uses very simple unfriendly interface. 

<p>To leave main screen with the program title press RUN/STOP.

<p>Screen must become filled with @. Now insert a tape in the datasette or 
attach a tape image to an emulator. Press PLAY on datasette (don't wait 
appropriate message!).

<p>Wait until tape motor stops and border becomes filled with fast changed 
colors. Press STOP on datasette. Press any key. (If used tape to tape 
copying then press PLAY & RECORD on datasette).

<p>Wait until a message appears on screen. This message has following 
structure: first 16 symbols is filename, next 4 hex digits forms start 
address of copied program (it's irrelevant for BASIC programs), next 4 hex 
digits forms beginning address of copied program, next 4 hex digits forms 
ending address (-3 for BASIC?) of copied program, last 4 hex digits is a 
format/loader identification sequence.

<p>Press STOP on datasette if needed.

<p>Press any key. The copying may be repeated with next program.

<p>NOTE. Transferred to disk (or tape) programs may require special loader. 
Tapecopy is unable to find exact beginning and ending of the programs 
instead that it fills all memory with 0 and after loading a program detects 
first and last nonzero bytes. This technique may give some first or last
zero bytes lost. In most cases it may be ignored. Mentioned special 
loader has to fill all memory ($800-$fcff) with 0 then loads a program and 
then starts it using known address.
