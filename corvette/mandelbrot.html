<b>
<p>It is based on an algorithm published on <a href=https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=87739>pouet</a> in 2021.  One its implementation uses planar writing mode and another color writing mode.  Generated pictures are 256x256 raster images (128x256 Mandelbot dots are computated) and show 4 or 8 colors respectively.  It is very likely that this algoritm implementation is the fastest known Mandelbrot set computation routine for the 8080.

<p>A zipped disk image with the executables is <a href=fast-mandel.7z>here</a>.  It contains four files:
<ul style=list-style-position:inside>
<li>M2.COM (v7) uses planar writing mode, it shows 4 colors and 4 textures;
<li>M3.COM (v6) uses color writing mode, it is faster and shows 8 colors and 8 textures;
<li>M3S.COM (v7) uses the same writing mode as M3 but it generates fullscreen (512x256) images (256x256 Mandelbrot dots are computated).  The next image is generated by this program;<br><img src=mandel-corvette-fsd.png>
<li>M3F.COM (v7) uses color writing mode, generates fullscreen (512x256) images without dithering (512x256 Mandelbot dots are computated).  It can also show 16 colors on the display.  The next image is generated by the program.<br><img src=mandel-corvette-fs.png>
