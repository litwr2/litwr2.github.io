<h1>Superfast Mandelbrot generator v3</h1>
<h2><img src=https://litwr2.github.io/mandelbrot8/mandel8-corvette-color.png></h2>

<b>
<p>It is based on an algorithm published on <a href=https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=87739>pouet</a> in 2021.  One its implementation uses planar writing mode and another color writing mode.  Generated pictures are 256x256 raster images (128x256 Mandelbot dots are computated) and show 4 or 8 colors respectively.  It is very likely that this algoritm implementation is the fastest known Mandelbrot set computation routine for the 8080.

<p>A zipped disk image with the executables is <a href=fast-mandel.7z>here</a>.  It contains four files:
<ul style=list-style-position:inside>
<li>M2.COM uses planar writing mode, it shows 4 colors and 4 textures;
<li>M3.COM uses color writing mode, it is faster and shows 8 colors and 8 textures;
<li>M3S.COM (v4) uses the same writing mode as M3 but it generates fullscreen (512x256) images (256x256 Mandelbot dots are computated);
<li>M3F.COM (v4) uses color writing mode, generates fullscreen (512x256) images without dithering (512x256 Mandelbot dots are computated).  The next image is generated by the program.<br><img src=https://i.ibb.co/4SqzMF5/corvette-m12f.png>
