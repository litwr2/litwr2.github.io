<h2>IBM System/370</h2>

<p>This part primarily focuses on comparing the mainframe machine language with other systems that were popular between the 70s and 90s. These are primarily the x86, 68k, VAX, and ARM. Systems 390 and, in particular, Z are considered very fragmentary â€“ the main attention is paid to the system 370.

<p>The first 360 systems began shipping to customers in 1965, and the more advanced 370 systems from 1970.  IBM maintains software compatibility with these systems to this day!  Surprisingly, before the systems 390, which were delivered, as you can guess from 1990, mainframes worked with 24-bit addresses, that is, they could address no more than 16 megabytes of memory, the same amount as, for example, the 68000, released in 1979, or the 65816 or 32016, released in 1982.  The VAX initially supported 32-bit addressing.  Popular processors 68020 or 80386, which appeared in the mid-80's, also supported 32-bit addresses.  Actually, 16 MB of memory for the best systems of the second half of the 80's was already not enough.  However, since 1983, IBM was producing 370-compatible computers that could use 31 bits for an address as an extension, which eliminated the problem of memory capacity for the best computers.  Unusually and uniquely, these extensions and the 390 systems used the 31-bit addressing rather than the full 32-bit one.  In 2000, IBM announced the first Z system that uses 64-bit addressing and data.  The Z systems have been using processor chips since 2008.  Since 2007, they have been trying to combine the Z architecture with the POWER architecture in a single chip, but so far without success.

<p>By the way, some computer authorities believe that the first serial personal computer was the IBM 5100, produced since 1975, which could execute instructions of the 360 system via a hardware emulator.  Its improved versions were produced until the mid-80's.  Although most likely the first was rather the Wang 2200.  For the price (around $10000) the first "personal computers" were clearly not for home use.

<p>With the advent of the IBM PC architecture, which, as it turned out, for decades determined the mainstream of development for computing, IBM tried in 1983 to combine almost all the best computer technologies in a single product the PC XT/370: their system 370, the IBM PC XT, the Motorola 68000 and Intel 8087.  This XT/370 could be used as a smart terminal for working with a mainframe, like a regular IBM XT, or to directly run mainframe software.  Interestingly, the XT/370 had support for using virtual memory, which required two 68000s.  In 1984, with the introduction of the PC AT, an improved version of the "personal mainframe" AT/370 was released, which in mainframe mode was about twice as fast as the XT/370.  This is not the end of the history of such systems, since the 90s, similar products were produced that correspond to the 390 systems.  As far as I know, such hardware has not been made for Z systems.

<p>IBM for its mainframes uses a rather unusual business model for today, in which computers are not sold, but are leased.  One of the advantages of this model is that it guarantees a constant upgrade of equipment, outdated equipment is automatically replaced with updated one of the corresponding class.  This model also has drawbacks.  For example, a particularly noticeable disadvantage for those who are engaged in the history of computer technology is that computers that have served their time are almost always disposed of and therefore they are almost impossible to find in any museum.

<p>It was amazing to find a live IBM 4361 system in <a href=https://www.livingcomputers.org/>LCM</a>!  However there is reason to believe that this may not be real iron.  For some reason, museum visitors have no access to this computer.  It is also unclear what model is allegedly represented there, and this is despite the fact that other computers in the museum are identified very accurately.  Among the 4361 systems, three models 3, 4, and 5 are known, with model 3 appearing later than models 4 and 5.  But the system in the Museum is self-identified as model 1.  It is possible that this is a prototype.  However, the museum staff did not answer a direct question about help with identification, and this is despite the fact that they answer other and often rather complex questions quite quickly.  Some features of code execution timings give grounds, although not absolutely firm, to assume that the emulator is most likely connected to the network.  In the summer, the museum, in connection with the covid pandemic, has overtly switched to an emulator... There is still a chance to get to the iron mainframes via the <a href=http://moshix.dynu.net/>HNET</a> network, but I have not yet succeeded.

<p>But whatever it is, everyone can connect and try to work in much the same way that high-paid professionals have worked since the mid-70s.  The prices were such that today it is difficult to believe.  For example, an hour of computer time cost more than $20 in the mid-80s and you still had to pay extra for disk space!  True, we are talking about the mainframe operating time, not the terminal through which the work was going.  This is why, for example, when editing a text, 5 minutes of payment time was rarely taken out of an hour of actual work.  The prices for the mainframes themselves were also fantastic.  For example, Intel employees recall that in the early 80's they were given only one mainframe to work with.  Its performance was 10 MIPS, and the price was about 20 million dollars then, which was three times heavier than today!  Interestingly, Intel preferred such computers over the cheaper VAX systems.  Now, even a tablet-sized Raspberry Pi at a few dollars can easily produce over 1000 MIPS.  By the way, on a Raspberry Pi or almost any modern computer, you can run the IBM/370 emulator, which will work much faster than any IBM system from the 80's or even 90's.  However, the emulator needs to be configured and not all useful programs for the IBM/370 are freely available, so free access to a well-tuned system is often the best way to work with the mainframe.  Surprisingly, such access programs, 3270 terminal emulators, are available even on mobile phones!  By the way, I managed to set up my VM/SP system on the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(emulator)>Hercules emulator</a> and deal with the file transfer, but it took at least a week of my time.

<p>The Hercules emulator can emulate the later IBM/390 and IBM/Z systems, but due to problems with the software license, this is much more difficult to do.  As an illustration of such problems, I will cite a well-known case when IBM insisted on removing the Emulation section from an already published book!  In modern electronic versions of this book, this section does not exist; it can only be found in the printed edition or as a separate file on sites dedicated to free software.  The fact is that emulation on regular personal computers since the early 2000s could be noticeably faster than execution on much more expensive mainframes.  IBM therefore had to change the licenses for its software so that it can only be legally used on hardware purchased from IBM.  Of course, it is not that emulators are faster than the best mainframes, they are only demonstrating a markedly better ratio of performance to cost.

<p>Let's now look at the features of the machine language of systems compatible with the 360.  The basic assembler of such systems is called BAL &ndash; Basic Assembly Language.  Surprisingly, if you believe the rumors about IBM, assembler is still one of the main working programming languages there.
