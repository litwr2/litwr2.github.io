<h2>Prologue and Epilogue</h2>

<p>I've happened to program with assemblers of different processors.  The last on this list is the Xilinx MicroBlaze.  I decided to put some of my observations on the features of these almost magical pieces of iron, which, like a magic key opened the doors for us to the magical land of virtual reality and mass creativity. On the features of modern systems the x86, x86-64, ARM, ARM-64, etc., I will not write, maybe another time &ndash; the topic is very large and complex.  Therefore, I finish on the Intel 80486 and Motorola 68040.  I also wanted to include in the review the IBM/370, which I had to deal with.  These systems were quite far from the mass users but had a huge impact on computer technology. They require much time to prepare materials about them, they didn't use chip-processors and there is somehow none of these machines left in existence, therefore they aren't included.  I really hope that my materials will also attract the attention of experts, who will be able to add something I have not thought about or didn't know.

<p>As illustrative material, I attach my <a href=https://github.com/litwr2/rosetta-pi-spigot>small stone from Rosetta</a>, tiny programs for calculating the number &pi; on different processors and systems using a ##<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spigot_algorithm>spigot-algorithm</a>##, claiming to be the fastest of its implementations.

<p>In conclusion, I make several remarks that I have got in the course of writing these articles.

<p>It is difficult to get rid of the feeling that 8-bit processors were only an undesirable necessity for the main characters acting in the 70's and 80's on the stage of computer history.  The development of the most powerful 8-bit 6502 was actually frozen.  Intel and Motorola rather slowed down their own development of small processors and restrained other developers.

<p>I'm pretty sure that the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga>Amiga</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST>Atari ST</a> would work better and faster using a 4 MHz processor compatible with the 6502 with a 20 or 24 bit address bus than with the 68000.  Bill Mensch said recently that itâ€™s easy to make the 6502 at 10 GHz today.

<p>If the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_PCW>Amstrad PCW</a> series (the success of which the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_CBM-II>Commodore CBM II</a> could have shared) had begun to use the upgraded Z80 at higher frequencies, then it is quite possible that this series would have been relevant 10 years ago.

<p>What would the world be like if the ARM had been made in 1982 or 1983?  In my humble opinion it was quite possible.

<p>What would computers made in the SU be like if they had copied and developed not the most expensive but the most promising technologies?
