To be fair, it should be added that officially the memory access period for the 68020 and 68030 takes 3 cycles, but in many instructions it actually turns out to be rather 4.

It can be surprising that the 68030 does not support several instructions of the 68020, for example, CALLM and RTM!

It is also worth noting that the mainframes used channels, specialized processors that made I/O very fast, much faster than it was for most other computers of those years.

Almost all string operations are limited to the maximum string length, no more than 255 bytes, that significantly reduces their power.
