By the way, the number of worst cases when quicksort slows down as much as possible and uses the maximum stack size is 2^(N-3) when using permutations of N different elements, with the total number of cases being obviously equal to N!. There are still a much larger number of cases where quicksort does not get much faster, but the total number of such cases of such severe braking is still very small when compared to the total number of cases. If we consider all possible cases of sequences of N elements, where each element can take M values, then the total number of cases will be M^N. Unfortunately, I could not find an exact formula for the number of bad sequences in this most general case. Of course, there are significantly more of them than in the case of using permutations from different elements, but it is practically well known that this is also a very small, almost zero percent of the total number of cases.

Despite the presence of two carry flags, addition and subtraction with carry support only two addressing modes, which makes them less convenient than such operations on the x86 - the 68000, thus, retained some of the clumsiness of such operations inherent the IBM/370 and, in part, the PDP-11.

Interestingly, one of the main developers of the 6502, Bill Mensch, was the first who was offered to make the ARM electronics.  But he immediately realized that the ARM is a competitor to the best developments of large companies and decided not to get involved, perhaps fearing that otherwise his company WDC will face the fate of MOS Technology.  The processor was eventually made by VLSI.

By the way, in 1999 VLSI lost its independence, becoming part of Philips.

All this is very surprising, since DEC achieved major success with the relatively inexpensive PDP-11 computers, and the rejection of their development in favor of the expensive, almost mainframe VAX turned out to be a voluntary rejection of further success.

The 68000 has also privileged instructions, which are necessary for multitasking support.  These instructions the x86 only got since the 80286 too.  On the other hand, privileged commands alone are not enough to completely support multitasking, and therefore their presence in the 68000, in contrast to the 80286, looks somewhat far-fetched.

It is also worth adding that a third stack (specifically for interrupts) was added to the 68020!
