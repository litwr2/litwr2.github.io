By the way, the number of worst cases when quicksort slows down as much as possible and uses the maximum stack size is 2^(N-3) when using permutations of N different elements, with the total number of cases being obviously equal to N!. There are still a much larger number of cases where quicksort does not get much faster, but the total number of such cases of such severe braking is still very small when compared to the total number of cases. If we consider all possible cases of sequences of N elements, where each element can take M values, then the total number of cases will be M^N. Unfortunately, I could not find an exact formula for the number of bad sequences in this most general case. Of course, there are significantly more of them than in the case of using permutations from different elements, but it is practically well known that this is also a very small, almost zero percent of the total number of cases.

Despite the presence of two carry flags, addition and subtraction with carry support only two addressing modes, which makes them less convenient than such operations on the x86 - the 68000, thus, retained some of the clumsiness of such operations inherent the IBM/370 and, in part, the PDP-11.
