<h1>Superfast Mandelbrot generator v1</h1>
<h2><img src=https://litwr2.github.io/mandelbrot8/mandel8-c128.png></h2>
<p>It is based on an algorithm published on <a href=https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=87739>pouet</a> in 2021.  One its implementation is for the 6502 under Basic and another is for the Z80 under CP/M.  Both variants use dithering to simulate 8 colors, 4x1 texture bricks are used per pixel.  Generated pictures are 512x256 raster images.  It is very likely that this algoritm implementation is the fastest known Mandelbrot set computation routine for the 6502 and Z80.

<p>Both ready-to-run programs are available in a zipped <a href=mandel-c128.tar.xz>archive</a>.
