<p>To use enhanced quicksort you must first load and run it, for example<br>
DLOAD"ENHANCEDSORT"<br>
RUN<br>
This program is the first file on the disk so you can also invoke it by CommodoreKey+Run/Stop.

<p>Then you may use a call<br>
SYS4145,N,START<br>
to sort your string array where N is a number of elements to sort and START is the first element in the range of elements to sort. For example,<br>
SYS4145,N,A$(0)<br>
means to sort N elements of array A$ from index 0 to index N-1. You may use any arithmetic expression in place of N, you may also use any arithmetic expression in place of any array index.

<p>You can load your program, for instance<br>
LOAD"A-BASIC-PRG",unit#<br>
that may contain the SYS in it.

<p>A demo program, which uses the SYS, can be loaded with<br>
LOAD"TEST-EQSORT",8<br>
and started with RUN. You may change the seed for the random number generator in line 20. This program also contains a non-recursive quicksort routine implemented in Basic (lines 5000-5300).

<p>This disk also contains a simple TXT/SEQ-file viewer that has name SEQREADER.
