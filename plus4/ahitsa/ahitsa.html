<p>I got my Plus4 in the beginning of 1987 without any external data storage.  I got my datasette only a month later.  So I needed a game which I could quickly type every time I wanted to play a little.  I invented this game then.  It was only about 50 Basic lines. Of course, it didn't have any title or sounds and it didn't redefine the character generator.  It didn't even have the score, the game ended either you got an adder or you were bitten.

<p>The original code has been lost, but the idea was pretty simple and straightforward.  So I was able to recreate it and add a few improvements.

<p>This game might be considered as a very primitive precursor of Minecraft. :) Its gameplay also has similarity with Xonix.  You need to build traps and restrict an area where the adder may move.  Then you should wait until the adder enters your trap.  This time you should use a stone as quickly as possible to get your trophy.  If the hunter directly assaults the snake there is a 50% chance that he will squash it but the beast is fast so it is a weak way to win.  The adder can move diagonally, the hunter can't.

<p>The next screenshots show the idea of hunting.

<p>After a success you may try to get a new trophy.  More trophies means a larger score.  This game requires as lot of patience and a bit of luck.

<p>The game is written in standard Basic.  Therefore it is rather slow with the ROM interpreter.  However the compiled variant is fast enough.  <a href=http://litwr2.atspace.eu/plus4/cbcwif.html>BCWIF</a> is used as a compiler.
