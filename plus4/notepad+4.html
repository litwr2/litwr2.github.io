<h2>Commodore Plus/4 edition, version 1 revision 6</h2>
<h3>It is very odd that Commodore which started the era of text processors missed an ordinary plain text editor.  This program is an attempt to make a right thing but after more than 30 years.  This is a lightweight and simple fullscreen text editor written in Basic.  It supports the work with any plain text files.  It may edit, in particular, a text with any line length.  It may be run under standard Basic but it is slow.  The distribution disk contains a compiled executable which is fast.  This executable is produced with <a href=plus4/cbcwif.html>CBCWIF cross-compiler</a></h3>
