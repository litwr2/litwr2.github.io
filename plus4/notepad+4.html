<h2>Commodore Plus/4 edition, version 1 revision 6</h2>
<h3>It's odd that Commodore, the company that started the era of word processors, didn't provide a simple plain text editor. This program is an attempt to do the right thing, albeit more than 30 years late. It is a lightweight, simple, full-screen text editor written in BASIC. It supports working with any plain text file. In particular, it can edit text with any line length. It can be run under standard BASIC, but it is slow. The distribution disk contains a compiled executable which is much faster. The executable is produced with <a href=cbcwif.html>CBCWIF cross-compiler</a></h3>
