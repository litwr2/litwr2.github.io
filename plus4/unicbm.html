<p>See the article <a href=c16cg.pdf>CBM 16/+4/116/64 character 
generator and Unicode (pdf, 110K)</a> (it also is 
<a href=http://plus4world.powweb.com/pubs/c16cg/c16cg.pdf>here</a>) and 
the page 
<a href=http://www.df.lth.se/~triad/krad/recode/petscii.html>PETSCII to 
Unicode mapping</a>.

<p>The mentioned above page documents contain a lot of useful information but 
also several inaccuracies:

<ol>

<li>It considers c64/16/+4 box drawing symbols as <em>light</em> but they are 
<em>heavy</em>. They are <em>light</em> only for vic-20.

<li>Some symbols names and Unicode numbers do not match - unicode 0x2501 is 
<em>heavy</em> not <em>light</em> as in the <tt>petscii*.txt</tt> files.

<li>The value of shift for the box drawing vertical and horizontal symbols is 
twice greater than it should be. 

<li>The symbols of quadrants (unicodes 0x2596-0x259e) aren't present in the 
mappings files.

<li>It's very hard to see the <em>medium shade</em> symbol in the symbol 
similar to part of chessboard.

</ol>

<p>The main disadvantage of proposed by the second article Unicode mapping 
is using of <em>private use area</em>. This is the same as using of IP 
Internet address reserved for private use (10.*.*.* or 192.168.*.* etc.) for 
access to the real WWW.

<p>The best solution will be the registration of the unique Commodore symbols 
as the part of the probable "8-bits computers compatibility" code chart.

<p>Two bytes area of Unicode is already nearly completely full so for this 
new chapter only 3 bytes codes may be really allocated.

<p>Some Commodore symbols are not easy to identify. One of this is "Check 
mark" or "Square root" symbol. The mention collision is reflected even in the 
official Unicode code charts &mdash; see "Dingbats" or "Mathematical Operators" 
charts of Unicode. It's more probable that in the CBM character generator 
this symbol means "Check mark".

<p>The basis idea of Unicode mapping is to create the possibility of exact text 
conversion between any computer systems. The mapping of control 
characters has significantly less importance for this task.

<p>The commodore code 160 may be mapped as "unbreakable space" symbol (0x00a0).
