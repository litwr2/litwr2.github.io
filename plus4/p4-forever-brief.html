<title>The C+4 'Forever?' emulator</title>
</head>

<body background=../cbm2.gif bgproperties=fixed>

<p align=right>Looks like I'm 'a do everything myself<br>
Maybe I could use some help<br>
But hell, you want something done right<br>
You gotta do it yourself<br>

<p>This emulator can be run only in the MS-DOS compatible environment (FreeDOS, PTS-DOS, DR-DOS, ...). 

<p>It has several strong points:

<ul>
<li>it can use 99% of C+4 programs;
<li>it has full support of the ROM-cartridges;
<li>it's fast (it runs at full C+4 speed even on P200);
<li>it has 100% datasette emulation (it supports PRINT#, OPEN, ...) using <a href=plus4dox.htm#17>CTF</a>;
<li>it's most compatible (it can be run on any IBM PC compatible hardware);
<li>it can use FM-synthesis for producing non-digital sound effects;
<li>it can use standard PC speaker or Sound Blaster to produce any sound 
effects;
<li>it has build-in debugger with large range of functions;
<li>it has the best emulation of Commodore FS over PC FAT or CD-ROM FS;
<li>it has the best fast IEC emulation for units 8 and 9 (2 x C1551);
<li>it provides system of menus for the momentary programs load, freeze/restore emulator state, export data, etc.;
<li>it's under GNU GPL.
</ul>

<p>Its weak points are:
<ul>
<li>serial bus devices are not supported;
<li>it supports only about 92% of all D64 images &mdash; turbo disk loaders support is still not implemented.
</ul>

<p>NOTE! Since version 1.17 this emulator is incompatible with Microsoft Windows GUI. Users of Windows 95/98/Me must use DOS mode. A way to run the emulator for Windows NT/2000/XP, Linux, FreeBSD, ... users is the creation of a DOS boot disk or bootable CD-ROM. 

<p>The emulator is compatible with <a href=http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/>DosBox</a> system but you will need at least 8 GHz CPU for 100% C+4 speed with proper sound. However Dosbox can run this emulator with full speed without sound even at 2 GHz CPU.

<p>It is also possible to use the universal virtualization application running with AMD/Intel PC CPU (VirtualBox, QEMU+KVM, ...) to run this emulator without sound. It requires only 200 MHz CPU for 100% speed.

<p>This program (since version 1.18) is distributed under <a href=http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>GNU General Public License</a>.

<p>In 1996 when I started to create this program I thought it would be the first and the last. But at least 7 different emulators exist now!  In 1997 I'd made last major changes in this my program. I've added some improvements since 2003.
