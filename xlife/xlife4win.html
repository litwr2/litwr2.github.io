<p>Download port (v6.7.5) for 
<a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bjYF49kQ6r0QAKC9K3EvXs4gLihCp5e7/view?usp=share_link>32</a>/<a href= https://drive.google.com/file/d/15qDGDdrKvURxUMzkkXoI0_UaXRohIQ_k/view?usp=share_link.zip>64</a>-bit
Microsoft Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> built by MingW.
<p>The program `lifeconv.exe' (to convert data) is just a copy of
`xlife.exe'.  Use it without redirection, e.g.,<br>
<code>lifeconv -M patt-in.rle patt-out.l</code><br><br>

<p>The <a href=http://www.cygwin.com>Cygwin<a>'s version has several
advantages over this port:
<ul>
<li>it has several times faster video performance
<li>it supports console text output (mingw has unfixed error for this)
<li>it looks smoother &mdash; Microsoft Windows' version may sometimes produce
"the screen artefacts", which maybe removed by r-command
<li>it has better tested
</ul>

<p>Xlife requires only minimum Cygwin support.  It is easy to install 
Cygwin, compile and use Xlife.<br><br>

<p>To build Xlife for Microsoft Windows with MingW you need to use Xlife sources and 
patched sources of David Kinder's wrapper for Xlife sources.  The compilation 
maybe described in the next steps:
<ol>
<li>Download, unpack, and patch Xlife sources
<li>Make a subdirectory at Xlife sources directory
<li>Download David Kinder's 
<a href=http://www.davidkinder.co.uk/xlife35src.zip>sources</a> and 
unzip it to the created directory
<li>Download <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w_aNSzjR8Head2fwzGwzj1YFlltfhEQQ/view?usp=share_link>patch</a>
<li>Convert end-of-line markers to Unix style at the wrapper's sources or 
to DOS style at the patches
<li>Apply patch
<li>Remove directory `include/sys'
<li>Change directory to X11Lib
<li>Check Makefile, write proper path to your compiler (CC, CXX and RESC 
variables values)
<li>Run `make'
<li>Try to run `xlife' or `lifeconv'
</ol>
<p>This process may have variations for the differrent compilers.
