<td>A convenient loader (no turbo) and autostarter (1991).  It is written in Basic.  It can start Basic and ML programs.  Fill the database that starts at line 10000.  Just enter 3 DATA-fields for every entry: filename, hexadecimal low byte of the start address, hexadecimal high byte of the start address &ndash; use zeros for the last two fields for Basic programs.  This program can handle up to 50 entries but it has a bug which limits this number to 25.  It is easy to fix this bug.  Just replace X in lines 2210 and 2220 with X/20.
